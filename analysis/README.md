It's more about __Design__ and __Modeling__.

# Description

It should be a supervised-learning and envolving system which can ajust the parameters (i.e. weights) assigned initially by our experiences. The system should also be able to learn anyone lying or not having enough evaluations on himself/herself based on statistics, or even to generate any assumptions, inductions or decisions to handle such things (too advanced, no needs at first time, but later).

## Analysis

A good team matching should be people with __different__ backgrounds which can be the whole skill sets for a project, and __same__ backgrounds which allow them to communicate with each other easily.

A good team matching also means that the probability of achieving a project is maximized.

It should be project-based team matching.

For different people with different attributes, it should recommend a lot such as courses, resources or projects.

Some conditions or constraints can be released.

LinkedIn, and GitHub can be  indicators of their levels from different perspectives.

Dynamic recommendation system

## Ideas

1. __P(__ proj | people __)__: project recommendation.
2. __P(__ proj2, proj3, ... | proj1, people1 __)__: team matching [personal perspective]
3. team matching [global perspective] [Same as Nash Point in Game Theory]
3. Based on clustering (__Kmeans__), different people are clustered together.
