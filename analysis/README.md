## Analysis

A good team matching should be people with __different__ backgrounds which can be the whole skill sets for a project, and __same__ backgrounds which allow them to communicate with each other easily.

A good team matching also means that the probability of achieving a project is maximized.

It should be project-based team matching.

For different people with different attributes, it should recommend a lot such as courses, resources or projects.

Some conditions or constraints can be released.

LinkedIn, and GitHub can be  indicators of their levels from different perspectives.

Dynamic recommendation system

## Ideas

1. __P(__ proj | people __)__: project recommendation.
2. __P(__ proj1, proj2 | people __)__: team matching
3. Based on clustering (__Kmeans__), different people are clustered together.
